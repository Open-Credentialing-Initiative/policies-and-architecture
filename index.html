    <h2>Keywords</h2>
    <p>
      The following keywords indicate the precedence and general rigidity of
      a given conformance criterion, and are to be interpreted as:
    </p>
    <li>
      <b>MUST</b> and <b>MUST NOT</b> indicate strict requirements from which no
      deviation is permitted.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>SHOULD</b> and <b>SHOULD NOT</b> indicate preferred approaches; among several
      possibilities one is recommended as particularly suitable, without
      mentioning or excluding others, but is not necessarily required, or
      that (in the negative form) a certain course of action is discouraged
      but not prohibited.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>MAY</b> and <b>NEED NOT</b> indicate possible and permissible approaches that are
      not necessarily preferred.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>CAN</b> and <b>CANNOT</b> indicate a capability, whether material, physical or
      causal or, in the negative, the absence of that capability.
    </li>
    Keywords appear in <b>bold</b> and <b>ALL CAPS</b> in the Conformance Criteria. The key words <i>MAY</i>,
    <i>RECOMMENDED</i>, <i>REQUIRED</i>,

    interpreted as described in BCP 14
    [[RFC2119]] [[RFC8174]] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals.

    <h2>Versioning of OCI Specifications and Documents</h2>
    <p>
      In order to ensure that external and internal stakeholders, which rely on the OCI framework and its surrounding
      documents,
      are not interupted or broken when the OCI releases new versions of its ecosystem, this policy describes how the
      OCI manages versions and releases of its documents.
    </p>
    <section>
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>
        The OCI manages versions of its releases on two different levels. These include:
      <ul>
        <li>Versioning on a <b>repository</b> basis</li>
        <li>Versioning on a <b>file</b> basis</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Versioning on a <b>repository</b> basis may occur when a group of semantically connected documents are published
        by the OCI.
        Changes in versions in a repository are always reflected via Releases found in the corresponding repository on
        github. For example: <a
          href="https://github.com/Open-Credentialing-Initiative/schemas/releases">https://github.com/Open-Credentialing-Initiative/schemas/releases</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Versioning on a <b>file</b> basis may occur when external stakeholders are directly consuming a file published
        by the OCI. This is often
        the case on <b>json-ld schemas, open-api specifications or other programatically requested ressources</b>. This
        is done to avoid breaking existing integrations and dependencies which directly consume these files.
        Any updates made to them mean that stakeholders have to concsiously update a link to a file in order to
        increment their version as well.
      </p>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Semantic Versioning</h2>
      <p>
        In order to version published work the OCI faciliates a well established and known versioning mechanims <a
          href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Versioning in the OCI is largely borrowed from the Semantic Versioning approach. The core principles are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Each document in the OCI <b>MUST</b> declare a semantic version</li>
        <li>A version number <b>MUST</b> take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are non-negative integers, and <b>MUST
            NOT</b> contain leading zeroes. X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version.
          Each element MUST increase numerically. For instance: 1.9.0 -> 1.10.0 -> 1.11.0.</li>
        <li>Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that version <b>MUST NOT</b> be modified. Any
          modifications <b>MUST</b> be released as a new version.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Changes in version have to adhere to the following guideline:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>MAJOR (X)</b> version whenincompatible changes are made.</li>
        <li><b>MINOR (Y)</b> version changes are made in a backwards compatible manner.</li>
        <li><b>FIX (Z)</b> version when backwards compatible fixes are made.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Interoperability Profiles</h2>
      <p>
        To ensure that OCI versioned documents remain interoperable a larger entity called <b>Interoperability
          Profile</b> is leveraged.
        An Interoperability Profile encapsulates multiple OCI versioned documents to ensure ease of use OCI users,
        integrators and stakeholders.
        As an integrator one can only to rely on the versioning of interoperability profiles instead of manually
        mananging multiple different OCI documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Increases in single OCI documents will be reflected in appropiate version changes in the connected OCI
        interoperability profile.
      </p>

        <figcaption>
          Example: an updated version in one of the conformance documents increments up to a new Interoperability
          Profile version. In this case, minor release increments up by 1.
