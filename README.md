## ✍️ Working with this template

Please see the [respec documentation](https://respec.org/docs/#sections) for an in-depth explaniation of all possible options for writing your 
proposal. However, a good base can be established by expanding your abstraction definition and including new sections for your proposal.
Some examples are already included in ```index.html```. 


## 📖 Github Pages

When you update the ```main``` branch of your proposal repository, the resulting content will automatically published to a github page that you can share. Using the default configuration your page should be accessible at:
